# Access to Minty's Dorm Room

Minty's dorm room looked normal with the exception of the key
grinder, as well as the strange man walking into his closet
and disappearing. The closet had a lock. All you needed to do
was find the key.

When I entered the room I made sure that the "Network" tab of
the Developer's console was open. That showed the PNG files
that were loaded, and one of the images was the strange man.
The file was named "krampus.png." I copied that file and
noticed the man had a key in the image. I cropped and rotated
it and used this image as a key impression to grind my own
key. After several attempts, I found the key combination was
122520.
