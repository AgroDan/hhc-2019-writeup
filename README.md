# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge, 2019

Hello. This is my second Holiday Hack Challenge, but the first writeup I've
ever done for one. Please bear with me.

# Story
Elf University has been hacked! Follow me as I do my best to write up the
incident, report on how I was able to accomplish everything, and ultimately
test my mettle with various Red Team/Blue Team tactics. Thanks as always to
@Edskoudis for an awesome Holiday Hack Challenge!
