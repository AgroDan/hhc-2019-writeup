# Door Code Challenge

This challenge could mostly be guessed, but the clues were:

1. One number is repeated once
2. It's a prime number
3. Only keys that have been pressed are 1, 3, and 7.

Using a prime number generator I found online in python, I generated
all prime numbers from 1000 to 9999, then eliminated those that had
any other number aside from 1, 3, and 7 in it. Ultimately the passcode
was 7331.
